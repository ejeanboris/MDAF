 
For each of the bi-objective problem instances, two feature objects (one per objective) were created via createFeatureObject, resulting in a total of 24 single-objective problems. Afterwards all 15 feature sets contained in FLACCO, with the exception of the general cell mapping and barrier tree features, are computed per scenario. Those features were excluded as preliminary studies did not reveal a substantial information gain in case of consideration. Note that not all discretized features have been discarded in general- the regular cell mapping features are part of the 15 considered feature sets.
